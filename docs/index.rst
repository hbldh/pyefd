An Python/NumPy implementation of a method for approximating a contour with a Fourier series, as described in [#first]_.

.. figure:: _static/pyefd.png

    EFD representations of an MNIST [#second]_ digit. Shows progressive improvement of approximation
    by order of Fourier series.

Installation
------------

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install pyefd

Usage
-----

Given a closed contour of a shape, generated by e.g. `scikit-image <http://scikit-image.org/>`_
or `OpenCV <http://opencv.org/>`_, this package can fit a
`Fourier series <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series>`_
approximating the shape of the contour:

.. code:: python

    from pyefd import elliptic_fourier_descriptors
    coeffs = elliptic_fourier_descriptors(contour, order=10)

The coefficients returned are the :math:`a_n`, :math:`b_n`, :math:`c_n` and :math:`d_n` of
the following Fourier series representation of the shape.

The coefficients returned are by default normalized so that they are
rotation and size-invariant. This can be overridden by calling:

.. code:: python

    from pyefd import elliptic_fourier_descriptors
    coeffs = elliptic_fourier_descriptors(contour, order=10, normalize=False)

Normalization can also be done afterwards:

.. code:: python

    from pyefd import normalize_efd
    coeffs = normalize_efd(coeffs)

To use these as features, one can write a small wrapper function:

.. code:: python

    def efd_feature(contour):
        coeffs = elliptic_fourier_descriptors(contour, order=10, normalize=True)
        return coeffs.flatten()[3:]

If the coefficients are normalized, then ``coeffs[0, 0] = 1.0``,
``coeffs[0, 1] = 0.0`` and ``coeffs[0, 2] = 0.0``, so they can be disregarded when using
the elliptic Fourier descriptors as features.

See [#first]_ for more technical details.

Testing
-------

Run tests with:

.. code:: bash

    $ python setup.py test

or with `Pytest <http://pytest.org/latest/>`_:

.. code:: bash

    $ py.test tests.py

The tests includes a single image from the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits ([#second]_) as a contour to use
for testing.
